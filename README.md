# operator_precedence_cpp
this is a cpp code that is capable of parsing strings using operator precedence rules
basically 
it will calculate experessions like "5 + 8 ^ 3"
using operator precedence rules.
and it also makes the operator precedence tables

Make sure you read the pdf to understand what this is all about ....also if you have Theory of compilers as a subject I highly suggest you go through this.

Problem statement
Write a program (C/Python) to implement a simple desk calculator using operator precedence parsing.
Output of the program should contain:
1. Precedence table (showing the precedence of only those operators (not all), which are
present in given input string).

2.Output of the calculator (on providing valid mathematical expression as an input to the
program. E.g. if input is 2+2 to the program then output of the program should be 4.

3. Error, if the input string is not valid.
